## How It's Made

**Tech Used**: HTML, SCSS, JavaScript. 

For this project, I wanted a simple way to get the free game offerings that were floating around the web. I created this around Black Friday of 2022, where lots of deals are abundant. 

A friend on Discord was posting the free games on a channel, and I figured "Hmm... what if there was a way to automate this?". The data comes from posts on Reddit in the r/freegamefindings subreddit, and uses the API to display the data on this site. 

## Optimizations

Ideally I would like to have used a framework, specifically React to create reusable components. Another thing that I could have done would have created a Discord bot to create notifications on a discord channel, rather than having users manually sort through entries. 

This was something I created with the knowledge I had so far. When I learn React and backend tech such as Node or Discord.js/python, I would rework this project.
